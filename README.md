# vidclassficatesystthruframes
In this project we have tried to simplify a very tough problem that is video classification. Video classification is tougher from 
image classification because here problem lies with the collection of dataset and training the model. The size of the video 
dataset is very large and also training the model with those dataset is a tough job as it consume time and not possible with 
normal daily use laptops with basic specs. So, for solving this problem we have designed a technique of implementing video 
classification through image classification. We know that videos are collection of thousands of frames (images) and therefore 
we have come out with a solution of converting videos into images and them forming image classification on them. This will 
reduce both the dataset size and also the model training time. We have designed a CNN model and used it in two application 
one is to classify sports video of cricket, football, hockey and another to classify hand shape using real human hand videos.
